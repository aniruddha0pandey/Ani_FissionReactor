# <div align="center">Aniruddha Fission Reactor</div><br/>
This is a Fission Reaction fully made using p5.js. I made this as a part of my [Physics Presentation](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1lJkgpXpYYBJ3KgMcuDQVe21qn83WK9HNGpAaqmEa73M/edit?usp=sharing) in second semester.<br/>
Without using any **HTML** at all!<br/>
The library included are:<br/>
- p5.min.js
- p5.dom.min.js
- p5.collide2d.min.js (taken from @[bmoren](https://github.com/bmoren/p5.collide2D))

<h3>Motivation used to make the isotope</h3>

The model for Uranium-235 isotope is made with a formula used to similar to mimic the spiral curve of a Hermit Crab Shell which is different from fibonacci series.

<h2>Yet to do</h2>
Actually their are lot of things to do, but first their is a serious need to change `frameRate()` function to `noLoop()` function as it is making the code a bit sloppy.
