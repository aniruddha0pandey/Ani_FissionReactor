This is a Fission Reaction fully made using p5.js.<br/>
The library included are:<br/>
- p5.min.js
- p5.dom.min.js
- p5.collide2d.min.js (taken from @[bmoren](https://github.com/bmoren/p5.collide2D))

The model for Uranium-235 isotope is made with a formula used to similar to mimic the spiral curve of a Hermit Crab Shell which is different from fibonacci series.
